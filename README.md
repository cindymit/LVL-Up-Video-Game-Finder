# Project Overview

## Project Name

Video Game Finder Database

## Project Description

This database will help users look up video games by title. By using and extraction data from RAWG's video games database API, I made an finder with a simple and easy user interface.

## API and Data Sample

Specify the API you are using and include a link. Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your API so we know you can access it and get the info you need

## Wireframes

Upload images of your wireframes to an image hosting site or add them to an assets folder in your repo and link them here with a description of each specific wireframe.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Add axios api call to find and use data from RAWG's Video Games Database.
- Render and log data on webpage. 
- Create a search bar that logs search text input.
- Allow user to search for video game by keyword (e.g. title name: Destiny)
- Change background of search results divider to image stored in api data.

#### PostMVP  

- Create and code second search bar to allow users to search by platforms. (e.g. platform name: Playstation 5)

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|April 16-18| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Incomplete
|April 19| Project Approval | Incomplete
|April 20| Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|April 20| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|April 21| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|April 22| MVP | Incomplete
|April 23| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Code Snippet
